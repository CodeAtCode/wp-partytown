# WordPress Partytown

This is an experimental plugin for WordPress that integrate [Partytown](https://github.com/builderio/partytown).  

Basically enqueue in the page the JS library and set a variable where to find the assets that need it. Replace also all the `script` type tag to partytown excluding the partytown itself in the page (enqueue natively in WordPress).

To check what services are supported by the library look on the library page.
